## Introduction

This article explains how Python list comprehensions may be used to solve the Knapsack problem. It aims to be an instructive study for beginners in Python and mathematical programming. By spending time on new examples in the learning process, you can improve your skills without slowing down and getting confused with complex mathematical modeling of the Knapsack problem. I hope this article will be very understandable and fun for beginners in Python and mathematical modeling.

## Knapsack Problem

The Knapsack problem is a real-world optimization challenge that every beginner in mathematical modeling encounters. It involves filling a backpack with the most valuable items possible, subject to weight constraints. The goal is to select a subset of items that maximizes the total value while keeping the weight within the knapsack's capacity. In this example, we have 4 items, and the knapsack's weight limit is 40.

## List Comprehensions

Python list comprehensions provide an elegant and concise way to create lists, especially when iterating. They make your code shorter and easier to understand. In this article, we'll explore three types of list comprehensions with examples to demonstrate their significance.

### List Comprehension without Condition

In this type, a list is created by iterating over a range and assigning the values to the list.

### List Comprehension with a Single Condition (IF)

In this type, a list is created by iterating over a range, but only the values that satisfy a specific condition are included in the list.

### List Comprehension with If-Else Condition

In this type, two lists are created, and the values are assigned to one list if they meet a certain condition, and to the other list if they don't.

## Solving the Knapsack Problem

To solve the Knapsack problem, we need to create a solution space containing all possible combinations of items that can be put in the bag. For this purpose, we'll use the `itertools.product()` function.

After obtaining the solution space, we'll choose the best result according to the capacity of the bag and find the combination of items that gives the maximum value within the weight constraints.
